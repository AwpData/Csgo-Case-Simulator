<h2> This program uses Unicode Characters! </h2> <br>
 * If you use Eclipse, it is set to use the default "Cp1252" text file encoding and this program must be set to "UTF-8"! <br>
 * In order to not get errors or missing characters (labeled with "?"): <br>
 * 1. Window > Preferences > General > Content Types, under "Default encoding", type "UTF-8" and click apply <br>
 * 2. Window > Preferences > General > Workspace, set "Text file encoding" to "Other : UTF-8". <br> 

<b> Not to worry, I will publish a .jar file when I complete the program so you don't have to execute through IDE</b>
